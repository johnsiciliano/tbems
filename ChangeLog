Version 0.3r2 -
 Fixed possible security issue that could be caused by 
local users replacing the eggdrop tar gz file with a tampered one in 
/tmp. Fixed by simply backing up the original, and getting a new one. 
While doing that, it also fixed amounts of excess file copies in /tmp.
Also added cleanup functions to delete the tar file, and directory in 
/tmp.
