This is an old toolset I wrote a long time ago that was on sourceforge.
It mainly allowed users to install eggdrop bots by creating a central eggdrop directory, and using symlinks allowed system users to acess the same binaries with their own configs.


Do the following things to create a working install.
Please note pay attention to the eggdrop-base-install
and check for errors.

 ./install.sh
eggdrop-base-install

Here's a short using eggdrop-lock documentation:

eggdrop-lock view views the eggdrop lock file
eggdrop-lock del [username] deletes a user from the eggdrop lock file
eggdrop-lock add [username] adds a user to the lock file
eggdrop-lock log Views eggdrop-install log
eggdrop-lock flush Flushes the lock file
